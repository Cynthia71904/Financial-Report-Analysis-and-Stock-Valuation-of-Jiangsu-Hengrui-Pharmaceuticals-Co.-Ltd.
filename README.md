# Abstract

This report analyzes the financial statements and stock valuation of Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (“Hengrui”) and compares its performance with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (“Fosun Pharma”). The analysis covers profitability, operating efficiency, solvency, and market value ratios from 2020 to 2022.

Results indicate that Hengrui’s profitability declined due to increased R&D investment, though its ROA and ROE remained above industry averages, reflecting stronger capital efficiency and risk resistance than Fosun. Hengrui’s liquidity ratios were extremely high, suggesting robust short-term solvency but low capital utilization. In contrast, Fosun relied more on debt financing, showing higher financial leverage but weaker stability.

Hengrui’s market valuation ratios, such as P/E and P/B, were notably higher, signaling investor optimism but also potential overvaluation risk given its falling net profits. Time-series analysis revealed that Hengrui has shifted toward an equity-based, low-leverage structure, while Fosun expanded through debt, increasing financial risk.

Based on weighted average cost of capital (WACC = 6.36%) and estimated sustainable growth rates (g ≈ 17–18%), Hengrui’s stock value suggests moderate growth potential supported by innovation-driven cash flows. However, continued R&D pressure, slower asset turnover, and policy uncertainty may constrain future expansion. Overall, Hengrui remains a financially stable yet efficiency-challenged leader in China’s pharmaceutical sector.
